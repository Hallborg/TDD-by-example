# TDD-by-example
A collection of the TDD examples by Kent Beck. 

This repository is my place to keep the code from Kent Beck's book
'Test-Driven Development By Example'. 

The actions taken to achieve this output is not present. Grab the book
and make a repository for your own. 

Since I'm using git, the book chapters are split up in commits.
